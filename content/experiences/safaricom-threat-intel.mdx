## Role Overview

As a Software Engineer in the Threat Intelligence team, I architect and develop an enterprise-grade cyber threat intelligence platform that protects critical infrastructure and customers.

## Key Responsibilities

- Design and implement distributed threat intelligence ingestion pipelines
- Build AI/ML-powered threat analysis and correlation systems
- Develop vector search capabilities for semantic threat matching
- Integrate with SIEM/EDR platforms for automated incident response
- Optimize system performance for real-time threat processing

## Technical Highlights

### Vector Search Engine

Implemented PostgreSQL + pgvector for semantic threat correlation, achieving sub-second query performance across millions of threat indicators.

### AI-Powered Classification

Integrated Vertex AI and Gemini 2.5 Pro for automated MITRE ATT&CK mapping and threat categorization with 95% accuracy.

### Scalable Architecture

Built microservices-based platform processing 100K+ daily events with multi-threaded ingestion and distributed processing.
